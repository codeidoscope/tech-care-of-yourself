- [Self-compassion exercises](https://self-compassion.org/category/exercises/#exercises) - Dr. Neff's list of exercises

Dr. Neff's website is a great resource to get started with self-compassion.
You can start by testing yourself on [how compassionate you are](https://self-compassion.org/test-how-self-compassionate-you-are/).
There are also a number of exercises offered on her website, including:

- [Exercise 1: How would you treat a friend?](https://self-compassion.org/exercise-1-treat-friend/)
How do you think things might change if you responded to yourself in the same
way you typically respond to a close friend when he or she is suffering?
This exercise walks you through it.

- [Exercise 2: Self-Compassion Break](https://self-compassion.org/exercise-2-self-compassion-break/)
This exercise can be used any time of day or night and will help you remember
to evoke the three aspects of self-compassion in the moment you need it most.

- [Exercise 3: Exploring self-compassion through writing](https://self-compassion.org/exercise-3-exploring-self-compassion-writing/)
Everybody has something about themselves that they don’t like; something that
causes them to feel shame, to feel insecure, or not “good enough.” This exercise
will help you write a letter to yourself about this issue from a place of
acceptance and compassion.

- [Exercise 4: Supportive Touch](https://self-compassion.org/exercise-4-supportive-touch/)
In this exercise you will learn how to active your parasympathetic nervous
system by using supportive touch to help you feel calm, cared for and safe.

She also offers [tips for practice](https://self-compassion.org/tips-for-practice/).
