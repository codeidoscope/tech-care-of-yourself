# Reframing Your Thoughts

Reframing thoughts is a common technique used in
[Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/about-cbt/).
Working on your own, or with a therapist, this technique is known for helping
with [anxiety](https://www.self.com/story/reframing-existential-anxiety) and
depression.

Using a [thought record sheet](https://www.psychologytools.com/resource/cbt-thought-record/)
you will be able to reframe negative thoughts in a more balanced way. If you
want to work on this on your own or while waiting to see a therapist,
[Mind Over Mood](https://www.mindovermood.com/) is a great workbook to guide you.
