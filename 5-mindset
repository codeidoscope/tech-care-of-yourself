# Upgrade your mindset

[Mindset](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40745.Mindset) is a book authored
by Carol Dweck, a Professor of Psychology at Stanford University. It posits that
there are two types of mindsets: a fixed mindset, that resists changes and believes
success can only come from talent; and a growth mindset, resilient in the face of
failure and mistakes, that constantly works on developing their skills.

Professor Dweck has delivered many talks on the subject, here is a short selection:
