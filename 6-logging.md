# Logging

Logging is a great tool to keep track of what you learn and look back at
problems you encountered and overcame.

You can find a detailed explanation of why I have found it so useful and how
to put it in practice in [my blog post on Dev.to](https://dev.to/codeidoscope/tracking-your-progress-to-improve-your-confidence-12lh)

Here is an extract of how I log:


## So, how do I log?

I have been using the following template for years, and it works well
for me. The beauty of logging is that you can make it your own and decide what
you want to keep track of, so if something does not help you, change it!

```
# Codelog #X - XXXX-XX-XX

-----

## Plan for the day

-----

## To investigate

-----

## Learned today

-----

## Done today

-----

## Plan for tomorrow

-----

## Resource list

```

With "Plan for the day", I set my intentions for the day and decide what I will
be working on, which keeps me accountable and helps me set goals. "Plan for
tomorrow", on the other hand, is where I will put the overflow of tasks I may
not have been able to complete on a given day, or I will set intentions for the
next day, which I will review when I start my log on that day.

I keep track of what I want to read about in "To investigate", I keep track of
my issues and their solutions in "Learned today", and I keep track of the useful
links I have found in "Resource list".

Here is an example of a completed log:

## Where do I log?

I used to keep my log on my blog, but I have
since moved them to their own repository as there were too many of them and it
was getting difficult to keep track of them.

If you want your own logs repository, I have created a
[template repository](https://github.com/codeidoscope/codelogs-template) for
you to use as you wish.

You can keep track of your logs in a Word/Google Docs document, or in a
note-taking app such as Notion or Obsidian (I recommend the Daily Planner plugin), or in a notebook, or on your website, or anywhere you want! Just make sure it is easy to find and navigate for when you need to look back through what you have.
