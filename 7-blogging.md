# Blogging

Blogging should be used a tool to help improve your own knowledge and increase
your understanding of an issue you encountered. If it helps others in the process
that's great, but blogging for oneself removes the pressure of writing about
something that was already written about, and the pressure of not feeling
technical enough.

[Dev.to](https://dev.to/) is a great community and platform for blogging,
particularly for people starting in development. Unlike Stack Overflow, it is
very welcoming and kind, and help is readily available.

Of course, what would be the fun of blogging without creating your own website!
There are plenty of frameworks created to help you just that, such as
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/),  [Jeckyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), etc. A bonus point is that you'll learn more about both backend
and frontend this way!
