# Asking For Help

Asking for help is a crucial part of the development process. You cannot know
everything there is to know about programming and computers, and problems that
sometimes feel that they should be easy to solve may turn out to be far more
complicated than anticipated.

There is a number of things you can do to ensure you get the best help possible.

1 - Timebox your problem-solving. 30min is a good rule of thumb to observe to
make sure that you do not fall down a rabbit hole of two. 

2 - When you ask for help, try to estimate how long you might need the person
for. This will make it easier for a coworker or a friend to determine whether
they can help or if you should ask someone else.

3 - Establish a hierarchy of people who can help. Do they have the right context?
Do they have the time to help you? Are they effective at helping you solve a
problem?

4 - Ask good questions. [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/)
talks at length about this topic and provides excellent suggestions of how to
best ask for help.
