Tools and strategies for better mental health in tech

Hi! Welcome to the companion repository for my talk '"Tech" Care of Yourself'.
You will find resources for all the tools and strategies that I discuss in my
talk, and I hope they will be of some help. If you have suggestion or a comment,
please feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/codeidoscope/tech-care-of-yourself/issues).

This talk originated as a blog post that I wrote while going through the
apprenticeship programme at [8th Light](https://8thlight.com/careers/). You can
read the improved version of my original post here: ["Tech" Care of Yourself: strategies for better mental health in tech](https://8thlight.com/blog/marion-lv/2019/06/18/tech-care-of-yourself.html).
